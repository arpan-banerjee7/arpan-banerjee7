### Latest project worked on
#### [Business_Profile_Service](https://github.com/stars/arpan-banerjee7/lists/crafts-demo) (Java, React, HTML, CSS) ‚≠ê [1]
A full-stack POC that supports products for Small Business owners: SmartBooks (FB) for Accounting, SB Payroll, SB Payments, and SSheets for time-tracking.

The Business Profile service ensures that every profile Create/Update request is approved by all the subscribed products of the user via REST API validation.
